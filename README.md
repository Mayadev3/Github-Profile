# Github-Profile

My Github Profile is a responsive search engine that lets web developers or a curious user to search for any person who has a github account. 
It displays the developer's name, photo,description, number of followers, number of people following them, the number of repositories and 
the names of the five most recent repositiories created. In addition, when a user clicks on the repository name, it directs them to the actual repository on Github.
