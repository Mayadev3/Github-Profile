# Github-Profile

My Github Profile responsive search engine lets web developers or any curious user search for a person or company which has a github account. 
It displays the developer's name, photo, description, number of followers, number of people following them, the number of repositories and 
the names of the five most recent repositiories created. In addition, when a user clicks on the repository name, it directs them to the actual repository on Github.

Coding Achievements:

- used async/await/fetch to get data from the Github API

- created the card element in javascript

- looped through the repositories

- inserted the API data into the DOM
